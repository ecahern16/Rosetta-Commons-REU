Python and Unix code for summer intern project through the Rosetta Commons REU at the Schoeder Lab in Leipzig, Germany. The pipeline_scripts folder showcases Python and Bash scripts written to execute my original pipeline that implements ProteinGenerator, Rosetta FastRelax, and Rosetta Protein-Protein Docking to design de novo protein binders for Immunoglobulin G3. The data_analysis folder holds scripts for creating graphs analyzing filtering metrics, mainly utilizing Matplotlib.
